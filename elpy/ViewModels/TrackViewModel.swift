// 1) The @Published property wrapper lets Swift know to keep an eye on any changes of this variable. If anything changes, the body in all views where this variable is used, will update.
// 2) Subscriber implementations can use this type to provide a ‚Äúcancellation token‚Äù that makes it possible for a caller to cancel a publisher. Be aware that your network calls won‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre not assigning your call to a variable of this type.
// 3) Fetching the data as soon as the ViewModel is created
// 4) Begins request
// 5) Handle errors here
// 6) Here the actual subscriber is created. As mentioned earlier, the sink-subscriber comes with a closure, that lets us handle the received value when it‚Äôs ready from the publisher.
// 7) Assigns the received data to the tracks-property - this will trigger the action mentioned in step 1
